abstract = {Radiologists inspect CT scans and record their observations in reports to communicate with physicians. These reports may suffer from ambiguous language and inconsistencies resulting from subjective reporting styles, which present challenges in interpretation. Standardization efforts, such as the lexicon RadLex for radiology terms, aim to address this issue by developing standard vocabularies. While such vocabularies handle consistent annotation, they fall short in sufficiently processing reports for intelligent applications. To support such applications, the semantics of the concepts as well as their relationships must be modeled, for which, ontologies are effective. They enable the software to make inferences beyond what is present in the reports. This paper presents the open-source ontology onlira (Ontology of the Liver for Radiology), which is developed to support such intelligent applications, such as identifying and ranking similar liver patient cases. onlira is introduced in terms of its concepts, properties, and relations. Examples of real liver patient cases are provided for illustration purposes. The ontology is evaluated in terms of its ability to express real liver patient cases and address semantic queries.},

abstract="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide. Moreover, the liver cancer field is evolving rapidly, with early diagnosis, new therapies, and a better understanding of HCC's biology and development. Accurate staging is important for determining prognosis and selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient. Surgical intervention remains the most effective treatment for HCC and is the only potentially curative modality. However, in HCC patients, overall survival is also independently affected by underlying liver disease and cirrhosis, which in turn affect the applicability and efficacy of treatment. Although several staging classification and prognostic scoring systems have been proposed for determining the stage and prognosis of HCC, no consensus exists on the best classification method. The most common staging classification systems include tumor-node-metastasis stage, Okuda staging, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification, the French, the Chinese University Prognostic Index, Japanese Integrated Scoring, and the Tokyo score. Radiologists should be aware of the different staging classification systems for HCC and familiar with the system relevant to their respective referring clinicians, as it will provide pertinent radiological evaluation for multidisciplinary management.",

abstract="Image annotation and markup are at the core of medical interpretation in both the clinical and the research setting. Digital medical images are managed with the DICOM standard format. While DICOM contains a large amount of meta-data about whom, where, and how the image was acquired, DICOM says little about the content or meaning of the pixel data. An image annotation is the explanatory or descriptive information about the pixel data of an image that is generated by a human or machine observer. An image markup is the graphical symbols placed over the image to depict an annotation. While DICOM is the standard for medical image acquisition, manipulation, transmission, storage, and display, there are no standards for image annotation and markup. Many systems expect annotation to be reported verbally, while markups are stored in graphical overlays or proprietary formats. This makes it difficult to extract and compute with both of them. The goal of the Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) project is to develop a mechanism, for modeling, capturing, and serializing image annotation and markup data that can be adopted as a standard by the medical imaging community. The AIM project produces both human- and machine-readable artifacts. This paper describes the AIM information model, schemas, software libraries, and tools so as to prepare researchers and developers for their use of AIM.",

Year="2013",

Abstract={The volumes of current patient data as well as their complexity make clinical decision making more challenging than ever for physicians and other care givers. This situation calls for the use of biomedical informatics methods to process data and form recommendations and/or predictions to assist such decision makers. The design, implementation, and use of biomedical informatics systems in the form of computer-aided decision support have become essential and widely used over the last two decades. This paper provides a brief review of such systems, their application protocols and methodologies, and the future challenges and directions they suggest.},

Abstract={This paper reports a controlled prospective unselected real-time comparison of human and computer-aided diagnosis in a series of 304 patients suffering from abdominal pain of acute onset.The computing system's overall diagnostic accuracy (91.8%) was significantly higher than that of the most senior member of the clinical team to see each case (79.6%). It is suggested as a result of these studies that the provision of such a system to aid the clinician is both feasible in a real-time clinical setting, and likely to be of practical value, albeit in a small percentage of cases.},

Abstract={The huge amount of information that needs to be assimilated in order to keep pace with the continued advances in modern medical practice can form an insurmountable obstacle to the individual clinician. Within radiology, the recent development of quantitative imaging techniques, such as perfusion imaging, and the development of imaging-based biomarkers in modern therapeutic assessment has highlighted the need for computer systems to provide the radiological community with support for academic as well as clinical/translational applications. This article provides an overview of the underlying design and functionality of radiological decision support systems with examples tracing the development and evolution of such systems over the past 40 years. More importantly, we discuss the specific design, performance and usage characteristics that previous systems have highlighted as being necessary for clinical uptake and routine use. Additionally, we have identified particular failings in our current methodologies for data dissemination within the medical domain that must be overcome if the next generation of decision support systems is to be implemented successfully.},

Title="{{P}otential of computer-aided diagnosis to reduce variability in radiologists' interpretations of mammograms depicting microcalcifications}",
Journal="Radiology",
Year="2001",
Volume="220",
Number="3",
Pages="787--794",
Month="Sep",
Abstract={To evaluate whether computer-aided diagnosis can reduce interobserver variability in the interpretation of mammograms.\\ Ten radiologists interpreted mammograms showing clustered microcalcifications in 104 patients. Decisions for biopsy or follow-up were made with and without a computer aid, and these decisions were compared. The computer was used to estimate the likelihood that a microcalcification cluster was due to a malignancy. Variability in the radiologists' recommendations for biopsy versus follow-up was then analyzed.\\ Variation in the radiologists' accuracy, as measured with the SD of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was reduced by 46% with computer aid. Access to the computer aid increased the agreement among all observers from 13% to 32% of the total cases (P <.001), while the kappa value increased from 0.19 to 0.41 (P <.05). Use of computer aid eliminated two-thirds of the substantial disagreements in which two radiologists recommended biopsy and routine screening in the same patient (P <.05).\\ In addition to its demonstrated potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to reduce the variability among radiologists in the interpretation of mammograms.},
